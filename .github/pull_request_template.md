<!--

    Thanks for your contribution! Please consider CONTRIBUTING.md.

    tl;dr:

    - we don't squash anything
      - to clean up, try: git rebase --interactive HEAD~5
    - please make sure all commits compile
    - please use conventional commit messages at least for the first commit and PR
    - please avoid breaking configuration or disrupting existing user workflows
    - In case of potential surprises,
      - please add a "!" for attention, e.g. "fix!", "feat!"
      - provide a small section that may be included in the release notes.
    - if there are conflicts, please rebase your branch onto main rather than merge main into your branch
      - git rebase <upstream repository>/main
    - if in doubt, ask us, we're happy to help
